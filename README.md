# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-CLV-and-Clustering.

The project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of a company's customer base to gain a deeper understanding of its characteristics, preferences, and behaviours. The aim is to use this information to tailor products and marketing strategies to specific customer segments by the analytics continuum model.

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company‚Äôs ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviours and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company‚Äôs database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

In this notebook, I will leverage the Data Science Analytics Maturity Model to conduct an in-depth customer segmentation analysis. By extracting precise insights from the dataset, I aim to provide effective solutions to address our client's challenges and enhance their business outcomes.

    
# **Soluation Architecture**
"Analytics Maturity Model" or the "Analytics Continuum". It represents the progressive stages of data analysis in increasing order of complexity and value:


- **Description Analytics:** Descriptive analytics is the foundational level of data analysis. It involves summarizing historical data to provide insights into what has happened in the past. This often includes basic statistics, visualizations, and summary reports. Descriptive analytics answers questions like "What happened?" and "What is the current state of affairs?"
Diagnostic Analytics:

- **Description Analytics:** Diagnostic analytics goes a step beyond descriptive analytics. It aims to understand why certain events or trends occurred in the past. This involves exploring relationships between variables, identifying patterns, and uncovering the root causes of specific outcomes. Diagnostic analytics answers questions like "Why did it happen?" and "What were the contributing factors?"
Predictive Analytics:

- **Description Analytics:** Predictive analytics uses historical data and statistical algorithms to make informed predictions about future events or trends. It involves building models that can forecast or estimate outcomes based on patterns observed in the data. Predictive analytics answers questions like "What is likely to happen in the future?" and "What are the potential outcomes?"
Prescriptive Analytics:

- **Prescriptive Analytics:** Prescriptive analytics is the highest level of data analysis. It not only predicts future outcomes but also provides recommendations or actions that should be taken to achieve a desired outcome. This involves using optimization and simulation techniques to determine the best course of action. Prescriptive analytics answers questions like "What should we do to achieve a specific goal?"
